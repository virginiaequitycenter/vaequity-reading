# **Education Inequity in Virginia**

README updated: November 2024

This repo hosts the R code to collect and prepare data and to build the
Reading and Math SOL Test Outcomes website for exploring education
inequities in Virginia.

**[Reading and Math SOL Test Outcomes in
Virginia](https://virginiaequitycenter.github.io/vaequity-reading/)**

## Background

We use Virginia Department of Education data on the Commonwealth’s
[Standards of Learning (SOL)
assessments](https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/student-assessment/virginia-sol-assessment-program)
to visually illuminate the significant gaps in reading and math pass
rates – between Black students as compared to their White peers, between
economically disadvantaged students as compared to their more fortunate
classmates, and between Hispanic students as compared to their
non-Hispanic peers. Research shows that lack of reading and math
proficiency have long-lasting impacts on future educational attainment,
future earnings, and more. We seek to make this data easier to use for
exploratory purposes, as a call to action, and hopefully, as a manner by
which localities can track progress in eliminating these gaps, and
working towards the goal of reading and math proficiency for ALL
students.

## Site Structure

The site is deployed using Github pages, and is designed to be modular
so that each data processing and app development step is separated from
another. The data processing and modeling are done in steps 1 and 2, and
the applications are created in steps 3 - 5.
