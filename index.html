        <h3>“Education, then, beyond all other divides of human origin, is a great equalizer of conditions of men—the balance wheel of the social machinery.”</h3>

              <p>This Horace Mann quote encapsulates the ideal role of public education in the United States. However, the state of Virginia and the nation as a whole fall well short of this ideal. We use Virginia Department of Education data on the state's <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/english/index.shtml">English Standards of Learning assessment</a> to visually illuminate the significant gaps in reading proficiency rates in the Commonwealth -- between Black students as compared to their White peers, between economically disadvantaged students as compared to their more fortunate classmates, and between Hispanic students as compared to their non-Hispanic peers. Research shows that lack of reading proficiency has a long-lasting impact on future educational attainment, future earnings, and more.  We seek to make this data easier to use for explorative purposes, as a call to action, and hopefully, as a manner by which localities can track progress in eliminating these gaps, and working towards the goal of reading proficiency for ALL students.
